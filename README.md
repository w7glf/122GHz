# 122GHz
 Software Update for 122 GHz Project
 
 This location holds my updated version of the 122GHz software
 
 It adds these features:
 
    Add an ability to signal when battery voltage goes low when using LiFePO4
    batteries (the knee is 12.8 volts rather than NiCad's 9.5 volts)

	Make the low voltage indicator a flashing light rather than simply turning 
    the LED on.
	
    Allow one to choose which way they want their LED to light.

    I shortened the time so it beacons the callsign every 5 seconds rather 
    than every 30 seconds.
